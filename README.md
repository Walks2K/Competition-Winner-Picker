# Competition-Winner-Picker
Developed for Ashby Town Council to randomly and fairly select winners for any competitions.

Very rudimentary WPF application that allows you to enter a list of entries separated by line (so could be ID's or names used) and will randomly select the amount of entries equal to 'Amount of winners' textbox.

The program shuffles the list every time it selects a winner to ensure fairness in the simplest way possible.

May test it more in-depth by recording the results so I can plot a graph from it.
